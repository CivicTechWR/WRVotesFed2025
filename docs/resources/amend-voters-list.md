# Registering on the Voters' List

voters' list. If your information is missing or incorrect, then you
have to register yourself via your municipality's municipal
clerk.

The instructions for doing this vary by municipality. Clicking the
municipality name should take you to the specific information page.

Note that in order to amend your information on the voters' list you
will have to provide appropriate [voter
