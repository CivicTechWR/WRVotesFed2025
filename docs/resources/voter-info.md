## Overview

#### What is this all about?

On October 24nd, 2022, are the Ontario municipal elections, including here in Waterloo
Region. Representatives for three areas of government will be elected:

- Regional government (Regional Chair and Councillors)
- Municipal governments (Mayors and Ward Councillors)
- School boards (Trustees)

There is an easy to understand voter's guide for the Ontario municipal election 
published by the province:
[2022 Voters'
Guide](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-voters-guide-ontario-municipal-council-and-school-board-elections).

There is an easier to understand summary [published by
settlement.org](https://settlement.org/ontario/immigration-citizenship/canadian-government/voting/a-guide-to-voting-in-your-municipal-election/).

#### Why should I vote in municipal elections?

Your municipal government is responsible for many of the services
that directly impact your daily life. We've put together a
[separate page](/resources/municipal-structure#what-do-the-different-levels-of-government-do)
with information to explain the roles and responsibilities of the different positions. 
Becoming engaged with municipal government is your choice -
do you want to have input into who's making decisions about
how your city functions?

The Region of Waterloo has also created [a series of
videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRVDwi_WScLn5k-iSrXjSRAM14iA5Ltgc)
in which local voters explain their reasons to vote.

#### I thought we just had an election?

On June 2 2022 Ontario had a provincial election. This is a municipal
election. Both sets of elections are currently held every four years.


## Voter Eligibility

#### Am I permitted to vote?

You may vote if you are a Canadian citizen who resides in Waterloo
Region, owns property here, or has a spouse who owns property here.
You must also be on the voter's list.

There are some exceptions to these guidelines that may prohibit you
from voting. There are also situations where you may vote in more than
one municipal election.

For more details, see the [Voter
Eligibility](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-voters-guide-ontario-municipal-council-and-school-board-elections/eligibility-vote)
section of the provincial voter guide.


#### I voted provincially. Am I registered to vote?

Not necessarily. The provincial register of electors is distinct from
the municipal one. The municipal List of Electors is managed by MPAC,
the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC).

This will change in 2024. At that time [Elections Ontario will maintain the voter list](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-voters-guide-ontario-municipal-council-and-school-board-elections/voters-list-and#section-0)
both municipally and provincially.



#### How do I register to vote?

MPAC maintains an
online tool for checking your voter registration at
<https://www.voterlookup.ca> . This is the place to start.
If your information is correct you will probably receive a voter card
in the mail.

If your information is not correct or you are not present on the site
then life gets complicated. Different municipalities have different
procedures for amending your information on the Voters' List. See the
[Registering on the Voters' List](/resources/amend-voters-list) page
for information specific to your municipality.


#### I am a student. Do I get to vote?

Yes. Depending on where your home address is, you may be eligible to
vote twice! See the Ontario [2022 Voters'
Guide](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-voters-guide-ontario-municipal-council-and-school-board-elections/eligibility-vote)
for more information.


#### I am homeless or have no fixed address. Do I get to vote?

Yes. Your voting address is considered to be the place where you ate
or slept most frequently during the last five weeks.


## About Voting

#### How do I vote? May I vote using the Internet?

This depends on the area municipality in which you live. Different
municipalities have different procedures, which we summarize below.
Click your municipality's name for detailed information: 


- [Cambridge](https://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/Elections.aspx):
  In-person voting Oct 6, 7, 11, 12, 15 and 24.
  Internet voting between Oct 7 to Oct 24.
- [Kitchener](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/council-and-city-administration/voting-in-kitchener.aspx):
  In-person voting Oct 12-15 and 24. 
- [North
  Dumfries](https://www.northdumfries.ca/en/township-services/information-for-voters-.aspx):
  In-person voting Oct 19, 22, 24 (but Oct 24 poll closes at 4pm?).
  Internet voting from Oct 11 to Oct 24.
- [Waterloo](https://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/when-and-where-to-vote.aspx):
  In-person voting Oct 8, 11-16, and 24. You can vote
  by mail, but must pre-register to do so.
- [Woolwich](https://www.woolwich.ca/en/township-services/information-for-voters.aspx):
  Internet, telephone, in-person voting. **Dates TBA.**
- [Wellesley](https://www.wellesley.ca/en/township-services/elections.aspx):
  Internet and phone voting only from Oct 10 to Oct 24. **There is no in-person
  voting.**
- [Wilmot](https://www.wilmot.ca/en/township-office/whats-new-for-2022.aspx):
  In-person voting Oct 15, 16, 22, 23. **There is no in-person voting Oct 24.**
  Internet and phone voting from Oct 14 to Oct 24.



#### Do I need a voter card to vote? Do I need identification?

If your area municipality allows voting in person then you do not need
a voter card. If your area municipality allows only Internet and
telephone voting then you will need a PIN, which is ordinarily mailed
to you.

In general you need to bring identification with you in order to
vote. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing publishes a list
of [acceptable documents for voter
identification](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-voters-guide-ontario-municipal-council-and-school-board-elections/acceptable).

If you do not have identification you may still vote, but you must be
registered on the voter's list and you must sign a declaration of your
identity. See the [voters' and
identification](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-voters-guide-ontario-municipal-council-and-school-board-elections/voters-list-and)
section of the 2022 Voters' Guide for more information.


#### There are a lot of positions to vote for! Do I have to vote for all of them?

No. You may refrain from voting for some positions if you wish; your
vote will count for the positions you did vote for.

Similarly, if a position elects more than one representative (for
example, there are four Kitchener Regional Council representatives)
then you are not obligated to cast four votes for that position.

#### I thought Cambridge had a referendum on ranked ballots. What happened with that?

There was a minimum of 50% turnout in the election for the referendum
to be binding, and only 27% of eligible Cambridge electors voted on
the question. More people voted in favour than against, but it did not
matter, because the provincial government banned ranked ballots with
Bill 218 in 2020. See the [Update on Ranked
Ballot](https://www.cambridge.ca/en/learn-about/update-on-ranked-ballot.aspx)
page on the Cambridge website for more details.

## Getting Informed

#### What parties are running in this election?

Unlike provincial or federal politics, municipal candidates in our
municipality do not run under party banners.

This has the advantage of potentially reducing partisanship, but it
means that candidates must be evaluated on their individual merits.

#### I don't feel informed enough to vote. Where do I start?

Start by finding your municipal ward on the [ward map](/) or by
finding your ward in the [list of wards](/wards). There you
can find the candidates running for each position in your area, their
websites, news articles about them, and events where they will be
appearing.

Once you know your candidates, it is time to figure out who deserves
your vote. Here are some strategies for becoming informed relatively
quickly:


- Attend all-candidates meetings for the races, or watch/listen to
  recordings of all-candidates meetings. This will cost you 2-4 hours
  per meeting, but is an effective way of comparing candidates against
  each other.

- Visit candidate websites and/or social media presences. This can
  give you a sense of what candidates stand for and whether their
  views correspond to yours, but is not great for comparing
  candidates.

- Read the answers to surveys posted by special interest groups.
  Reading responses from different (especially opposed) groups is a
  good way to assess how candidates respond differently to different
  audiences.

- Read news coverage of candidates. Beware that some news coverage on
  social media feeds are written by advocates for particular
  candidates, and thus will be biased towards that candidate (and away
  from the competition).

There are also less effective strategies, such as voting for whatever
candidate comes to your house and shakes your hand. Politicians know
this strategy is effective, and they devote a lot of time to this, but
other than identifying candidates who put time into door-knocking it
does not give you much information about which candidates are best for
their jobs.

#### I don't feel informed enough to vote and there is not much time left.  What do I do?

If you are stretched for time, you can follow one or two races and
cast informed votes for those. The regional level of government is
important, and many people do not pay sufficient attention to regional
council candidates. Other influential positions are mayors and
regional chair.

Spending an hour watching or listening to one all-candidates meeting
can help you select the best candidates quickly.

Alternatively, you can follow one or two races by reading the campaign
literature (in printed form or on the Internet) from the contenders,
and choosing the candidates that match your views most closely.

#### How do I follow what is going on during the election?

Local media provides lots of election coverage. Here are a few hubs:
- [CBC KW: Waterloo Region
  Votes](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kw/topic/Tag/Waterloo%20Region%20Votes%202022)
- [New Hamburg Independent Municipal Election
  Hub](https://www.newhamburgindependent.ca/newhamburg-on-news/municipal-election/)

On Twitter you can track the
[#wrvotes](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wrvotes) and
[#wrpoli](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wrpoli) hashtags.


## Getting More Involved

#### How high is voter turnout in municipal elections?

Voter turnout tends to be significantly lower than for provincial or
federal elections. For the 2018 election, the Region of Waterloo [published
results](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/regional-government/past-results.aspx)
indicating that overall turnout was 31%, ranging from 
a low of 29.7% in Cambridge to a high of 40.5%
in Wilmot township. 

In 2014, they
[ranged](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/voter-turnout-in-waterloo-region-stagnant-overall-1.2815625) from a low
of 29.3% in Wellesley township to a high of 40.6% in Wilmot township.

Voter turnout in provincial and federal elections tends to be much
higher.
Overall turnout for the 2021
federal election [was
62%](https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2021/09/22/election-turnout-plunges-in-waterloo-region-and-across-the-nation.html),
and in the 2022 Ontario provincial election [was
45%](https://www.therecord.com/news/provincial-election/2022/06/03/most-in-waterloo-region-did-not-vote-with-voter-turnout-hitting-just-45-per-cent.html).
These turnout numbers were much lower than previous federal and
provincial elections, but still were much higher than municipal ones.



#### I want to organize an all-candidates meeting. What do I do?

If there are not enough all-candidates meetings for the positions that
interest you (spoiler: there probably aren't) then you can organize
your own. This is not difficult, but does take some time and planning.

The City of Toronto had a [guide to ward all-candidates
meetings](https://web.archive.org/web/20180127004940/https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/get-involved-how-government-works/how-the-city-works/learning-guides/ward-all-candidate-meetings/).
This was written pre-pandemic, and contains some Toronto-specific
information, but remains a good guide to the structure of an
all-candidates meeting.


Some of the volunteers on this website also have experience in
organizing all-candidates meetings, and would be happy to offer
guidance. Contact us using the email at the bottom of this page.

Once you have started organizing your meeting, be sure to let us know
about it so we can publish it on this website!


#### What other groups are working on election education?

Bob Jonkman posts a candidate listing on his [poliblog
site](https://poliblog.jonkman.ca/Poliblog-Elections/2022-10-24-Municipal-Election/).
We use his data in our candidate listings -- thanks, Bob!

Melissa Bowman publishes a blog about urban issues and local politics
at <https://citified.substack.com/> . Although the blog is relatively
even-handed the blog reflects Bowman's own views.

The Region of Waterloo links to election information for the different
municipalities at <http://wrvotes.com> .

A group called the [Waterloo Region Women's Municipal Campaign
School](https://learnhowtorun.com) held workshops on how to run for
political office. Several election candidates during this election
credit the campaign school for inspiring them to run for office. They
have a Twitter account here:
[@wrwomenrun](https://twitter.com/wrwomenrun).

There is a related initiative called [The Kitchen
Cabinet](https://thekitchencabinet.ca/) which aims to support women,
trans and non-binary candidates in the election.

[For a Better Waterloo Region](https://linktr.ee/FABWR) is largely an
advocacy group for progressive causes, but did hold one information
meeting for potential candidates.
