### What is even happening?

In addition to voting for members of municipal government, you may
cast ballots for **school board trustees**.

Depending on which school board you are registered for, you might
elect anywhere from one to four representatives for your school board.


### What are school board trustees? What do they do?

School board trustees are elected representatives from the community.
They set
policies for their school board, provide oversight of the
board's Director of Education, and serve as community advocates for
education.

For a more in-depth explanation, see the [What Do Trustees
Do?](http://elections.ontarioschooltrustees.org/WhatDoTrusteesDo/SchoolBoardTrustees.aspx)
page on ontarioschooltrustees.org

For a more personal take on the duties of a school board trustee, see
the transcript of [this speech by Ted
Martin](./ted-martin-on-being-a-trustee).

Trustee Scott McMillan [identifies the role of school
trustees](https://www.kitchenertoday.com/kitchenervotes/get-to-know-the-responsibilities-of-a-school-board-trustee-before-you-vote-1064230) as
managing the budget and facilitating communication between parents
and school staff. 

### There are so many school board positions listed! What do I vote for?

There are four school boards in Waterloo Region:

- English Public (the Waterloo Region District School Board)
- English Catholic (the Waterloo Catholic District School Board)
- French Public (Conseil scolaire Viamonde)
- French Catholic (Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir)

When you register to vote you are associated with a school board. By
default you are registered to vote in the English Public system.
However, if you qualify then you may choose to register with one of
the other three systems. You may only vote for the school board
nominees in your school board.

In our candidate listings we list nominees for all four school boards.
Pay attention only to the school board that applies to you.


### I don't have kids in school. May I still vote for school trustees?

Yes. All eligible electors may vote for trustees in their assigned
school board.


### May I change what school board I vote for?

If you are eligible to support a different school board, you may do so
by changing your information on the voters' list.
