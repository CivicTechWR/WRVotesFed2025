    Waterloo Region Votes is a nonpartisan initiative to
    increase voter engagement during elections.

  </div><div>

    In particular, this
    project aims to make it easy for our community:
    <ul>
      <li>to find out who is running in their geographic area.</li>
      <li>to learn more about candidates by linking to candidate
      websites and social media, upcoming all-candidates meetings and
      events</li>
      <li>to learn more about voting and the election by linking to
      election-related resources</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

Over 9000 people used the municipal iteration of the site during the
2018 election and the project was featured in the [Waterloo Region
Record](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8847728-techies-mobilizing-for-this-fall-s-municipal-elections-in-waterloo-region/),

## Are you a third party advertiser?

No. According to the [Ontario government definition of a third party
advertiser](https://www.ontario.ca/document/2022-third-party-advertisers-guide/third-party-advertising),
waterlooregionvotes.org is not a third party advertiser. This website
does not support or oppose any particular candidate; it exists to
increase voter engagement. 


## How do you select news and media items for the site? What counts as an opinion?

This site is manually curated. Broadly speaking, we link to media items that help voters learn about their candidates and decide which ones to support. There are some judgment calls involved, but here are our rules of thumb: 

- Many organizations and special interest groups publish surveys or endorsement lists. We almost always link to these.
- We usually link to candidate profiles published by local media organizations as "News".
- We sometimes link to profiles of outgoing candidates.
- We link to some (but not all) discussions of candidates published on
  social media, usually as "Opinion" pieces. The guiding principles
  are
  whether the article helps voters learn something new about their
  candidates, or learn about issues that have come up during the election.

"Opinion" pieces are an especially fuzzy area. We do not link to every
opinion piece we encounter. There are good reasons to read opinion
items with a skeptical eye. Opinions pieces are often authored by
pseudo-anonymous people. Sometimes opinion pieces are written by a
person associated with a particular campaign, or somebody who pretends
to be neutral but has a strong agenda. Sometimes they contain
statements that are hyperbolic or incorrect. Opinion pieces can still
be useful, but do not rely upon them too heavily. They often
illustrate conversations and controversies that come up during the
campaign.

Similarly, you should exercise caution when reading endorsement lists. Say the Society for Pineapple on Pizza (SPoP) endorses Candidate A. This means that SPoP believes Candidate A to be more closely aligned with its goals than other candidates. It does not mean that Candidate A actually supports SPoP more than non-endorsed candidates. It does not mean you should automatically vote for Candidate A if you support pineapple on pizza; nor should you automatically reject Candidate A if you oppose it. One of the nice things about municipal elections is that voters from very different political orientations often end up supporting the same candidate. Whether you support or oppose SPoP, looking through its endorsement list can give you a rough sense of which candidates might align with your views.

This website does not endorse the content of any particular linked material, or any particular candidate. For example, we are happy to link to endorsement lists published by groups opposed to each other. 

If we do not see a particular resource we won't be able to link to it. If you see something we have missed, please send it along! We do not promise to link everything we are sent, but we will consider it all. 


## How to Help

Use the site! Learn about the election so you can cast an informed
vote. If there are aspects of the site that are confusing or
misleading, let us know.

Spread the word! Encourage your friends, family, and social media
contacts to use this site, especially if they are not engaged in
municipal politics already. There are convenient sharing links at the
bottom of each page on the site.

Improve the content! Are we missing information about candidates, events,
questionnaires or news coverage? Contact us at
{{ contact_email}} and submit it to
the site. Crowdsourcing resources helps improve the site for everyone.
We currently could really use help with:

- Monitoring local news media
- Monitoring Facebook and Twitter for election-related news and events
- Tracking down candidate information (especially websites)
- Contacting neighbourhood associations and other local groups
- Helping with promotion
