    Waterloo Region Votes is a nonpartisan initiative to
    increase voter engagement during elections.

  </div><div>

    In particular, this
    project aims to make it easy for our community:
    <ul>
      <li>to find out who is running in their geographic area.</li>
      <li>to learn more about candidates by linking to candidate
      websites and social media, upcoming all-candidates meetings and
      events</li>
      <li>to learn more about voting and the election by linking to
      election-related resources</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

Over 9000 people used the municipal iteration of the site during the
2018 election and the project was featured in the [Waterloo Region
Record](https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8847728-techies-mobilizing-for-this-fall-s-municipal-elections-in-waterloo-region/),

Waterloo Region through civic technology.

## Are you a federally registered third party?

[NEEDED FOR MUNICIPAL?]

No. As of June 13, 2019, there are new [Elections Canada rules for
third
parties](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&document=index&dir=thi/roadmap&lang=e).
Individuals, corporations or groups spending $500 or more on regulated
activities that take place during the pre-election period or election
period need to register as a third party to conduct regulated
activities like partisan activities, election surveys, partisan
advertising and election advertising.

CivicTechWR’s only expenditure on waterlooregionvotes.org is domain
registration for the website.


## How to Help

Use the site! Learn about the election so you can cast an informed
vote. If there are aspects of the site that are confusing or
misleading, let us know.

Spread the word! Encourage your friends, family, and social media
contacts to use this site, especially if they are not engaged in
municipal politics already. There are convenient sharing links at the
bottom of each page on the site.

Improve the content! Are we missing information about candidates, events,
questionnaires or news coverage? Contact us at
{{ contact_email}} and submit it to
the site. Crowdsourcing resources helps improve the site for everyone.
We currently could really use help with:

- Monitoring local news media
- Monitoring Facebook and Twitter for election-related news and events
- Tracking down candidate information (especially websites)
- Contacting neighbourhood associations and other local groups
- Helping with promotion
